# Clustering - Fish Species based on Spawning Temperature

Unsupervised learning approach (K-means) is applied to 159 fish species. Data was based on the [Ontario freswater Fishes life History database]
The goal of this algorithm is to find 3 groups in the data based on spawning temperature.

The algorithm splits the data in three groups based on the distance feature. Each cluster centroid is marked with a blue circle. Results show fish species preference of spawning temperature.
