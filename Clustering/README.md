# Clustering - Fish Size Species based on Spawning Temperature

Application of unsupervised learning approach (K-means) is applied to group 159 fish species based on temperature (C) reported in the [Ontario freswater Fishes life History database]
The goal of this algorithm is to find 3 groups in the data based on spawning temperature.
